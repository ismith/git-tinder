Runs \`git add -p\` in ... Tinder mode.

Swipe right to stage a hunk (IYKWIM. \`man git-add\` if not, or leave your mind
in the gutter ;-) ), swipe left to give it a pass.

This also supports splitting the current hunk if you pinch out. (Or pinch in, or
swipe up - I have had better luck getting those to register.)

All swipes are 3-finger gestures.

INSTALLATION
=============
Put this in your PATH, and it'll work as a git subcommand (\`git tinder\`).
